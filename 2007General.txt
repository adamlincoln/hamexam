2007 Element 3 General Class Question Pool

(Revised February 23, 2007)

This is the official release of the 2007 Element 3 Questions pool from the Question 
Pool Committee of the NCVEC


This file is normally available to the public in Adobe PDF (Portable Document 
Format).  VECs and other interested parties requiring an editable version of the pool 
should contact the QPC directly, or check the NCVEC web site at NCVEC.ORG.  

There are 484 questions in the pool.

Section G7A requires the use of one illustration, a schematic drawing.  This drawing 
is available in JPEG and BMP (Windows Bitmap) versions upon request. The drawing file 
is published separately.  The applicable graphic is identified as G7-1. 


As always, VECs are free to correct minor typographical and punctuation errors, 
including obvious minor omissions.  Such corrections must not cause a change in the 
meaning of a question or any of the proposed answers to that question.  Also, since 
rule citation references are not part of the question itself, but are included only 
to assist instructors and students when looking up the applicable section of the 
rules, errors in the reference identifiers are not considered adequate reason for 
removal of a question from the pool. 


Please note that in this version, question G5B10 and G2C06 have been removed. Other 
questions in these sections were not and should not be renumbered.
